    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There are many weird and wonderful ways to fry an egg, such as frying in cream, freezing the eggs for 48 hours first, or separating the yolks from the whites,<br>
       but cooking a good old-fashioned sunny-side-up egg is easy to make and ready in only a few minutes. However, they can be tricky to get just right. There<br>
       is nothing worse than raw egg whites or overcooked yolks when striving for a sunny-side-up egg. Ideally, the eggs should have whites that are just set<br>
       and runny yolks that look like they are ready to burst. Hereâ€™s how to achieve that. </p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat a medium non-stick or cast-iron skillet over medium heat for 3 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon olive oil, swirl to coat the pan, and heat until the oil is<br>
          shimmering, 1 to 2 minutes. Meanwhile, crack 2 large eggs into 2 separate small ramekins.</li>
      <li>Slowly pour 1 egg into one side of the skillet; repeat with the second egg on the opposite side. Cover with a lid or plate and immediately reduce the<br>
          heat to low. Cook undisturbed until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny, 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Slide the eggs onto a plate (or use a turner if using a cast-iron skillet to help transfer). Season each egg with a generous pinch of kosher salt and a<br>
          grind or two of freshly ground black pepper. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
